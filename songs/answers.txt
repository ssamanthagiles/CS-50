If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?/

I would look at the data in the songs database, then organize dive deeper at the type of genre most songs is, than look at the most frequent
artist and see what kind of genre that artist falls under and also look at the attribute tempo in order to find a person's audio aura.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Getting user input itself might be a better way to calculate the audio aura because the user could be listening to a specific type of music
(i.e sad music simply becasue they're feeling depressed at the moment), but that may not be their music of choice (which is also why the
data may not be entirely representative). Also another why to make the data more representative is doing it over a longer period of time, to
see how a user's preferences in songs has developed from the start.
